I am a MSc Computer Science student at the University of Bonn, Germany. I am interested in Virtual Humans, Denoising Diffusion Models, and Neural Radiance Fields.

Currently, I am working on a Master Thesis "Denoising Diffusion for Mesh Correspondence". Previously, I worked on a NeRF-based 3D reconstruction of a hand at ETH Zurich.
