              - Developed a NeRF-based 3D reconstruction of the human hand from 60 images; evaluated on âˆ¼500 sequences from the Interhand3.6m dataset <br>
              - Implemented a point-mesh distance finding algorithm on the GPU; reduced the calculation time from 5s to 0.3s compared to the CPU baseline <br> 
              - Introduced perceptual loss (LPIPS) to enhance the visual quality; improved PSNR score by 14% over MSE loss <br>

              - Developed a dark matter detection model using satellite images of neutron stars; processed 3.1 TB of data collected over 4 years <br>
              - Utilized Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) network to upscale low-resolution satellite images; improved SSIM metric by 11% over the baseline bicubic interpolation <br>
              - Implemented a background subtraction model based on the R-CNN network; achieved a 3x speedup compared to the GrabCut algorithm <br>
